#Where is my stuff?  
-Enter an item you want to track.
-Enter where it is.
-Voila. 

A simple application as a springboard to demonstrate AngularJS playing friendly with Rails.  
I've seen a lot of examples using rails to generate forms in conjunction with Angular views, but that just seemed silly to me.

Things about this:

* Rails version 4.1.5

* PostgreSQL

* AngularJS Front End using $resource

* Rails backend responds with JSON.

Future plans:

* Use the framework for my other, more complete apps.

* Experiment with a search feature.

* Swim in a pool full of gold coins.
